                    Hey! I`m <strong>Yakov</strong>
                    Coding has changed my world. It`s not just about apps.
                    Learning to code gave me <i>Problem-solving skills</i> and a way to comunicate
                    with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use mw coding slills to get a better job.
                    Ang I learned it all by <strong>Practising</strong> gave me a lot of self esteem, and keeps me motivated.
